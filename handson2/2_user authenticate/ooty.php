    <h1>OOTY-queen of hills</h1>
    <p>Ooty (short for Udhagamandalam) is a resort town in the Western Ghats mountains, in southern India's Tamil Nadu
        state. Founded as a British Raj summer resort, it retains a working steam railway line. Other reminders of its
        colonial past include Stone House, a 19th-century residence, and the circa-1829 St. Stephenâ€™s Church. Its
        55-acre Government Botanical Garden lies on the slopes of Doddabetta Peak.</p>
