    <h1>Odisha</h1>
    <p>Odisha (formerly Orissa), an eastern Indian state on the Bay of Bengal, is known for its tribal cultures and its
        many ancient Hindu temples. The capital, Bhubaneswar, is home to hundreds of temples, notably the
        intricately-carved Mukteshvara. The Lingaraj Temple complex, dating to the 11th century, is set around sacred
        Bindusagar Lake. The Odisha State Museum is focused on the areaâ€™s history and environment</p>
